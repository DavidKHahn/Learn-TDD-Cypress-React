## Learn TDD in React

### Setup
First, create a new React app:

``$ npx create-react-app learn-tdd-in-react``

Now, run your app and leave it open for the duration of the process:

                $ cd learn-tdd-in-react
                $ yarn start

``create-react-app`` comes with Jest preinstalled, so all we need to add for component testing is React Testing Library:

                $ yarn add --dev @testing-library/react

Next, we need to add Cypress:

                $ yarn add --dev cypress

Add an NPM script for opening Cypress into your package.json:

                {
                ...
                "scripts": {
                    ...
                +    "cypress:open": "cypress open"
                    }
                ...
                }

Now open Cypress and it will initialize your app:

                $ yarn cypress:open

As our last setup step, letâ€™s clear out some of the default code to get a clean starting point. Delete all the following files and folders:
